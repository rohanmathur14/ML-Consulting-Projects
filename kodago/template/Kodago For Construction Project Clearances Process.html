      <p>If you run a construction company and are stuck while organizing your data, then this blog is just the right solution for you. Give this blog a 5 min read, and know-how construction companies can get rid of all the workflow complexities that might come across preparing the final report.</p>

      <p>Constructing companies have been struggling with clumps of data for ages. Capturing the data, collecting it, and managing all of that data in an organized way is one of the most nerve-racking tasks for companies. They spend hours of hard work to get the structured reports of the construction site. </p>

      <p>To do away with such a dragging work, we introduce you to "KODAGO", the ultimate data collection tool. This tool does wonders to your data collection and management practices. </p>

      <p>Want to know how? </p>

      <p>Traverse through this blog to get all the relevant information about how this tool works for your construction company.</p>

      <p>But, before advancing forward, let us first understand the general process of clearance that a construction company goes through.
      </p>

      <h3>General Process To Get Clearance</h3>

      <p>For any site to get constructed peacefully, it requires getting all the allowances and sanctions from the respective authorities. Any commencement of the project without these mentional lists of approvals invite huge penalties and sometimes stay in order. </p>

      <p>One of the most common approvals is "Environmental Clearance". There are certain steps that are to be followed to get the clearance.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>The project proponent adheres to the existing siting guidelines before the commencement of the proposed plan which is followed by the EIA report.</li>
         <li>After the EIA report is ready and is approved by the state pollution control board (SPCB), it issues the NOC, i.e. the consent to establish the property.</li>
         <li>SPCB then arranges the public hearing to hear the objections/suggestions from the public.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All these documents consist of images of the approved land, videos of public hearing, documents related to construction project, google map coordinates of the proposed land, information consisting of clearance status, and much more.</p>

      <p>It is a tedious task for the construction company to manage diverse types of information all together under one file. This invites chaos within the workflow. </p>

      <p>All the documents along with images, map coordinates, and videos are then aggregated together to be submitted to the environmental appraisal committee. </p>

      <p>Once the assessment and evaluation of the project report is completed, the clearance is finally granted to the project proponent.</p>

      <h3>Challenges Faced By The Project Proponent To Manage The Clearance Report</h3>

      <p>Let's understand it this way; as a project manager under a construction company, you are required to manage the volumes of data that you receive from the field engineers.</p> 

      <p>The data includes various types of information such as
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li>Important documents</li>
         <li>Google map coordinates</li>
         <li>Associated pictures</li>
         <li>Clearance status, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As a manager, it is a tedious task to manage such different types of data altogether. You tend to rely on diverse platforms to store distinct information, which yields nothing but chaos.</p>

      <p>For example, you have relevant documents stored in your mailbox, pictures on your cloud drive, map coordinates on your laptop and other miscellaneous information on your chat group with engineers.</p> 

      <p>Racking up all the information into a unified record is nothing less than a tiresome and overlong task. You need to grab different data from different platforms, which takes ample time.</p> 

      <p>Well, you end up with a mismanaged workflow and toned down productivity. And here comes to your rescue, "KODAGO", the ideal solution to the unorganized data.</p>

      <p>Here's how Kodago helps organize your datasets and produce reports effectively.</p>

      <h3>Kodago- The Optimum Solution For Efficient Productivity</h3>

      <p>"Organizing is a journey, and not a destination", and Kodago helps you drive through the entire journey smoothly and swiftly. </p>

      <p>We at Kodago believes that "For every minute spent organizing, an hour is earned", and we aim to produce enormous efficiency and productivity with every single data entry. How?</p> 

      <p>Let's have a look.</p>

      <p>Kodago is a data collection tool that helps you store the aggregated data and manage it without any fuss. Instead of storing the information on different platforms, Kodago offers you a one-stop solution that allows you to enter diverse forms of data all into one single platform. </p>

      <p>Here's the rundown of various ways by which Kodago has proved to be the saviour for the construction companies. 
      </p>

      <p><b>1. Multiple File Racks to enhance the working efficacy</b></p>

      <p>Compiling the data is an exorbitant job. It takes a plentiful amount of time to gather all the information from various sources such as chat groups on mobile, emails, paper, etc. This makes the entire process a mammoth task.</p>

      <p>However, with Kodago, you can set off the excessive work done to combine the data. The file rack feature enclosed with the tool helps you create multiple file racks to collect different ranges of data such as images, text, locations, date, etc. This, therefore, helps your construction company to store distinct information about the clearance process under the same file. </p>


      <p><b>2. Custom data sharing formats to store clearance data in a structured way</b></p>
      For a construction company, it is required to store the data in various formats to produce the final clearance progress report. It includes GPS locations of the working team, images of the ongoing work, clearance status along with the respective date and much more. </p>

      <p>Kodago helps you to enter the custom data entry formats for the different fields to store all the relevant information in the structured and organized way for future analysis.</p> 

      <p><b>3. Enable efficient group interactions to minimize the re-work</b></p>

      <p>Clubbing the entire working team together at one place at the same time is beyond the bounds of possibility. But with Kodago, you can collaborate with your team effectively.</p>

      <p>It sends the customized notifications to the admin of the file rack the moment the group member adds a new record or comment on the existing one. This improves the internal communication between the group members irrespective of their physical locations. </p>

      <p>Also, this allows the group admin to have access to the real-time data along with all the relevant details. This enables structured communication within the group and minimizes the inefficiencies and re-work.</p>

      <p><b>4. Single screen access for the entire clearance database</b></p>

       <p>"Efficiency is doing things in the right way", and Kodago is the ultimate platform for the same. It enhances the flow of work and improves the productivity of the team.</p>

      <p>Kodago acts as the hub of the diverse database that can be viewed on a single screen as and when required. With Kodago, you can just navigate to the respective file rack to accumulate the entire data that includes relevant images, videos, map locations, date, and related documents. </p>

      <p>This tool helps you ease your work and yield a better performance by combining the entire clearance data on a single screen. </p>

      <p><b>5. Generate real-time data analytics report</b></p>
      <p>What data reveal is suggestive, but what insights reveal is vital, and the goal of Kodago is to turn raw data into structured information and information into valuable insights. </p> 

      <p>With kodago, you can get into the layers of the collected data to generate real-time data insights that can help you track your clearance progress at any time. </p>

      <ul>
         <li>The project proponent adheres to the existing siting guidelines before the commencement of the proposed plan. If the plan does not abide by the rules, the proponent looks for another site.</li>
         <li>Once the site is selected, the proponent conducts EIA if the proposed land falls under the purview of environmental clearance.</li>
         <li>After the EIA report is ready and is approved by the state pollution control board (SPCB), it issues the NOC, i.e. the consent to establish the property.</li>
         <li>SPCB then arranges the public hearing to hear the objections/suggestions from the public.</li>
         <li>After adding certain clauses that align with the suggestions by the public, the final report, along with the EIA report and NOC by SPCB, is submitted to the ministry of forest and environment or the state government depending upon the selected site. </li>
         <li>The application form is then submitted to the Environmental Appraisal Committee to hold consultations with the experts. The recommendations of the committee are then proposed to the concerned division of ministry for approval or rejection.</li>
         <li>Once the assessment and evaluation of the project report is completed, the clearance is finally granted to the project proponent.</li>
      </ul>
