      <div class="blog-wrapper main-blog">
         
         <p>Collecting and managing large volumes of unstructured datasets have always been a daunting task for all the major organizations such as the survey companies that revolve around the never-ending ocean of data. These working units are constantly looking for a responsive data collection tool to capture the data records securely for future analysis.</p>

         <p>NGOs and survey companies collect a plethora of unorganized data and process it to make informed decisions. These companies are always running scared of losing the entire pool of data due to the mismanaged workflow system.</p>

         <p>But the question that arises is what methodology these survey companies should adopt in order to store the collected data in an organized way?</p>

         <p>Simple, a data collection tool like Kodago is a one stop solution to all the stumbling blocks. In this blog, you will get the detailed description of how Kodago works for your survey company and why should you invest in this tool.</p>

         <p>So, let’s dive in.
         </p>

         <h3>But first thing first, What is Data Collection Software? </h3>

         <p>A data collection software is a website/mobile app that stores qualitative and quantitative survey data electronically. Standing in 2021, when the whole world is thriving towards a revolutionary digital transformation, there’s no point in using the old-school pen/paper surveys. </p>

         <p>Simply stating, a data collection software is built for businesses of all sizes to gather data from a targeted source and manage its workflow without hampering productivity. Unlike paper-based data collection methods, here you don’t have to worry about data loss.</p>

         <img src="assets/img/blogs/blog3/data-software.jpg" class="full_w" alt="">

         <p>And the best part is that it gives access to all the team members to add or view the data for their respective work. Still confused?</p>

         <p>Let’s dive deeper into the blog and know-how your survey company/NGO can be benefitted by Kodago.
         </p> 

         <h3>6 ways Survey Companies/NGOs can use Kodago</h3>

         <img src="assets/img/blogs/blog3/kodago.jpg" class="full_w" alt="">

         <p><b>1.  Multiple Data-racks can save Excess time for Compilation</b></p> 
         <p>If you have performed any research in recent times, you already know the struggles involved in data compilation. In the absence of data collection software, NGOs and survey companies need to spend a long time compiling different datasets that they have collected through mobiles, MS Word/Excel, or pen and paper. All these make the surveys even more painful. </p>

         <p>However, with Kodago, you can bid goodbye to all these struggles. Kodago comes with the multiple data racks feature. Hence, you can collect a different range of datasets like images, videos, text, location, etc., and store them on different file racks under the same survey file. So that when the time comes, you get to consolidate all data types painlessly.</p> 
         <p><b>2. Collect Datasets Offline</b> </p>
         <p>Kodago’s mobile app helps you capture necessary datasets from different sources, even though you’re offline. With the Kodago app, you can collect data efficiently through your smartphones or tablets. Once you get the internet connectivity, you just have to upload the datasets to the platform. It’s that simple. </p>

         <p>Hence, if you run an NGO or a survey company and need to visit remote locations where internet connection has not reached, you don’t need to worry. Kodago has got you covered. Just collect the datasets and upload them whenever you get back the connectivity. </p>

         <p><b>3. Build Survey Forms Online</b> </p>
         <p>Whoever has been involved in research works, knows that creating survey forms requires a lot of effort. A survey form is the only way to communicate with your target respondents and get their opinions. So if your survey form doesn’t ask the right questions, the future of your entire research can get affected. </p>

         <p>With Kodago, you don’t have to worry about creating survey forms. This data collection software ensures that your paper-based survey forms are converted into the electronic version as it is. So, accessing the survey forms for capturing research data is no longer an issue. </p>

         <p>Kodago knows your struggles behind creating an apt survey form. We want you to focus on that only. Leave the technical aspects to us. Our user-friendly online form builder is extremely easy to use and customizable based on your survey requirements. </p>

         <p>So, for all NGOs and survey companies out there, online survey form building or converting a paper-based form into an electronic format is no longer a challenge. </p>
         <p><b>4. Collaborate with Teams effectively</b> </p>
         <p>The secret to any successful survey is effective team collaboration. But, what if all team members are not present at the same place at the same time? Considering the global pandemic, is it possible for all your team members to be physically present at the survey locations? </p>

         <p>No! But then how would you communicate? A survey without any coordination or collaboration is nothing short of chaos. Is there a way out? Well, yes. </p>

         <p>Kodago helps team collaboration a lot simpler than it sounds. In the Kodago app, you can add different groups to store your survey data. Additionally, the administrator can provide access to as many team members as they want to access these datasets from anywhere and anytime. </p>

         <p>Due to privacy concerns, Kodago offers different types of access options like “view only”, “view your own datasets”, “view all datasets” etc. If you’re the administrator of a survey, you need to give access to permissions to your team members, and that’s it. </p>

         <p>Also, the administrator can manage the existing users, invite new users and remove any users as per their requirement. Kodago makes team collaboration seamless for survey companies and NGOs.</p> 
         <p><b>5. Get real-time data insights</b></p> 
         <p>Once your data collection process is complete, then comes the most critical phase viz. Data analysis. Survey companies and NGOs need effective data analytics tools to get to the depth of collected data.</p> 

         <p>But, if you use Kodago, you can be relieved to some extent. Kodago helps you generate real-time data insights through top-notch visualization. So you can generate graphs aligned with your research and track them over time to understand your research behavior. </p>
         <p><b>6. Enable Customized Reminders</b> </p>
         <p>Kodago also sends customized calendar notifications and reminders based on the research process. All the team members and participants will receive notifications related to the date and time of data collection. Kodago also lets you send personalized messages with emojis and language changes. </p>

         <p>So, don’t worry about notifying the respondents by yourself. Kodago has got your back. 
         </p>

         <h3>Final Words</h3>

         <img src="assets/img/blogs/blog3/survey-companies-helped-by-kodago.png" class="full_w" alt="">

         <p>Survey companies or NGOs should always focus on completing their research efficiently. To do so, they need proper tech support. There’s no point in using paper-based data collection as it invites unnecessary errors and probable mistakes to your research. </p>
